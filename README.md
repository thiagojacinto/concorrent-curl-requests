# concurrent-curl-requests
Python script to execute curl requests

## Usage

With [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, just run the following commands: 
```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/thiagojacinto/concurrent-curl-requests.git

# then use the python script
python3 concurrent-curl-requests/get_server_info_parallel.py
```

## Objective

Changing a little from the bash scripting habit. Simple usage of Python's own modules and concurrent benefits and availability of well known `curl` lib to handle HTTP requests. 

Made just for learning purposes. And fun. Have fun while using it!
